This application takes a input from a user and analysis it whether the user provided sentence is subjective or objective.


For that, i have used the MeaningCloud API where we send the api key, user provided text and language and get the response from the API.

That response is being printed on the UI for displaying the result to the user.

This app uses webpack to bundle the assets and provide separate working environments for dev and prod environment.
